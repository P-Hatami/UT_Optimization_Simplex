# UT_Optimization_Simplex
MATLAB script for Simplex Tableau initialization. It constructs the canonical augmented matrix by integrating the objective function, constraint coefficients, and slack variables. This setup is the essential precursor for performing pivot operations and iterative optimization in Linear Programming.
